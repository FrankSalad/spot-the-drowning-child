  <h1>Great, you spotted the child. Avoid drowning yourself.</h1>
  <p>When a swimmer is exhibiting the instinctive drowning response and someone approaches them,
  the drowning person will attempt to cling on and climb. This can lead to a multiple drowning incident. Untrained rescuers can easily be overwhelmed and drowned themselves. <span class="source">Source:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21827292">PubMed</a></span></p>
  <p>For this reason, it is inadvisable for untrained rescuers to approach drowning people directly.</p>

  <h2>So what can you do?</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Alert a lifeguard.</li>
  <li>If you can reach the person securely from the side of the pool, try to hoist them out without sliding in yourself.</li>
  <li>Grab a floating object like a life preserver or buoy with a rope, throw it PAST the drowning person, and pull it in using the rope.</li>
  <li>If you have a life preserver or buoy approach keeping it between you and the person drowning.</li>
  <li>As a last resort, approach the drowning person from the back.</li>

  <h1>Drowning Doesn't Look Like Drowning</h1>
  <p>The Instinctive Drowning Response -- so named by Francesco A. Pia, Ph.D., is what people do to avoid actual or perceived suffocation in the water. And it does not look like what most people expect. There is very little splashing, no waving, and no yelling or calls for help of any kind. To get an idea of just how quiet and undramatic from the surface drowning can be, consider this: It is the number two cause of accidental death in children, age 15 and under (just behind vehicle accidents) -- of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult. In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening.
  <p>Drowning does not look like drowning -- Dr. Pia, in an article in the Coast Guard's On Scene Magazine, described the instinctive drowning response like this:

  <quote>
  <ol>
  <li>Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs.
  <li>Drowning people's mouths alternately sink below and reappear above the surface of the water. The mouths of drowning people are not above the surface of the water long enough for them to exhale, inhale, and call out for help. When the drowning people's mouths are above the surface, they exhale and inhale quickly as their mouths start to sink below the surface of the water.
  <li>Drowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the water's surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water, permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe.
  Throughout the Instinctive Drowning Response, drowning people cannot voluntarily control their arm movements. Physiologically, drowning people who are struggling on the surface of the water cannot stop drowning and perform voluntary movements such as waving for help, moving toward a rescuer, or reaching out for a piece of rescue equipment.
  <li>From beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response people's bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick. Unless rescued by a trained lifeguard, these drowning people can only struggle on the surface of the water from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs.
