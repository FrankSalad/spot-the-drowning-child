Lifeguarding Game

[spotthedrowningchild.com](http://spotthedrowningchild.com)

I wanted to figure out a better way of spreading knowledge about the instinctive drowning response. People who are drowning often go unnoticed by others closeby. 

What better way to teach people something then to make it a game. Inspired by [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9947237): can you notice who's drowning in the pool before the lifeguard does?

Help out by adding to the video library. I [created a tool](http://spotthedrowningchild.com/creator.html) to make this easier. Copy and paste the part of the youtube video URL in the box at the top and press enter to load the video, move the and scale the red area around the person that is drowning and use the time buttons to indicate the time points of the three states: when drowning begins, when the lifeguard notices it, and when the lifeguard reaches the person. Copy and paste the code in the brackets into a [new issue](https://github.com/FrankSalad/spot-the-drowning-child/issues/new) and I'll do my best to include it in the live game.
