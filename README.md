Lifeguarding Game

[spotthedrowningchild.com](http://spotthedrowningchild.com)

I wanted to figure out a better way of spreading knowledge about the instinctive drowning response. People who are drowning often go unnoticed by others closeby. 

What better way to teach people something then to make it a game. Inspired by [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9947237), try to notice who's drowning in the pool before the lifeguard does.
