Lifeguarding Game

[spotthedrowningchild.com](http://spotthedrowningchild.com)

Drowning people can be easy to miss. Once someone's instinctive response has taken over, they oftentimes look like they're swimming and go unnoticed by others closeby.

Inspired by [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9947237): can you notice who's drowning in the pool before the lifeguard does?

Help out by adding to the video library. I [created a tool](http://spotthedrowningchild.com/creator.html) to make this easier. Follow the instructions on the page and I'll do my best to include it in the live game.
