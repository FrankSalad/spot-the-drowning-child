Lifeguarding Game

[spotthedrowningchild.com](http://spotthedrowningchild.com)

Drowning people can be easy to miss. Once someone's instinctive response has taken over, they oftentimes look like they're swimming and go unnoticed by others closeby.

Inspired by [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9947237): can you notice who's drowning in the pool before the lifeguard does?

Help out by adding to the video library. I [created a tool](http://spotthedrowningchild.com/creator.html) to make this easier. Copy and paste the part of the youtube video URL in the box at the top and press enter to load the video, move the and scale the red area around the person that is drowning and use the time buttons to indicate the time points of the three states: when drowning begins, when the lifeguard notices it, and when the lifeguard reaches the person. Copy and paste the code in the brackets into a [new issue](https://github.com/FrankSalad/spot-the-drowning-child/issues/new) and I'll do my best to include it in the live game.
