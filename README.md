Lifeguarding Game

[Spot The Drowning Child](http://spotthedrowningchild.com)

Drowning people can be easy to miss. Once someone's instinctive response has taken over, they oftentimes look like they're swimming and go unnoticed by others closeby.

Inspired by [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9947237): can you notice who's drowning in the pool before the lifeguard does?

Confirmed working on desktop browsers only. Unfortunately iOS doesn't let me play YouTube embedded in the browser window. 

Help out by adding to the video library. I [created a tool](http://spotthedrowningchild.com/creator.html) to make this easier. Follow the instructions on the page and I'll do my best to include it in the live game.
