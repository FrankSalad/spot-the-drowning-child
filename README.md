Lifeguarding Game

[Spot The Drowning Child](http://spotthedrowningchild.com)

Drowning people can be easy to miss. Once someone's instinctive response has taken over, they oftentimes look like they're swimming and go unnoticed by others closeby.

Inspired by [this hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9947237): can you notice who's drowning in the pool before the lifeguard does?

Confirmed working on desktop browsers, mobile experience is a work in progress. If you've found a bug, do let me know [in an issue](https://github.com/FrankSalad/spot-the-drowning-child/issues/new). Android users especially (I don't have an android to test on, unfortunately.)

Help out by adding to the video library. I [created a tool](http://spotthedrowningchild.com/creator.html) to make this easier. Follow the instructions on the page and I'll do my best to include it in the live game.
